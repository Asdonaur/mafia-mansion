# The Mafia Mansion
This is a project I made as my first try of "making a serious game".
But, as Bad Job Corporation, the development didn't go too well for this game. 

Playable version: https://asdonaur.itch.io/the-mafia-mansion

## What can you do with this code?
- You can download the code and run it in Unity.
- You can modify the code to make mods, and publish them to the internet, giving respective credits (Asdonaur, for creating the base game)

## What can't you do with this code?
- You can't reupload any the files in this repository or the game itself and claim them as yours.
- You can't sell anything from this repository.

Thanks for reading!
