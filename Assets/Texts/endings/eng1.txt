We got in time to the hospital...
For his last words.

Maggie's uncle was too damaged to take care of her, or live more.

He gave me the thanks for saving Maggie.
Maggie grown up with him by her mother's petition, so Hershell Maff could not make Maggie a gangster.

After telling us that, he gave his last breath.



Poor Maggie. It felt like her heart broke in that moment.

I decided to take care of Maggie.

I lost everything before, so I know how alone she feels.



Probably Mr. Maff will acuse me and the police controlled by him will search for us.
But he has no power outside of this country, so that's my plan.



We are going to the other side of the world, so he can't get us.
That's not difficult to do with my fortune. At least it's useful for something.

Maybe it is not okay to escape from the police, but this is the only way.
Probably in the future, we are going to try to take him down, and clean our names.
But for now, we have to escape.



Anyway, this is Alex... I mean, Alexander Guyy, and that was my experience in the Mafia Mansion.
