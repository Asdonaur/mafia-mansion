After that, I returned to what I do every day.
Wander alone in the streets.

Thats what I have been doing after I won the lottery.


I won a lot of money, but I lost my family, friends, and everything else.
And that is my fault.
I ignored them for days.
Maybe I deserve it.


I dont know why I got in that mansion in first place.

I had the feeling that the girl was kidnapped, and I dont know why.

I beaten those guards and entered the house... For no reason.


Why am I like this?


Anyway, this is Alexander Guyy, and that was my experience in the Mafia Mansion.
